<h1>Page Designs</h1>

<p>
For my site's main pages, I wanted to design a <em>Online Dating Website</em>for programmers. So, for the parts of the page, I just using some characteristics of computing codes.
</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="design1.png" alt="page 1 design" width="520" height="400" />
</div>
<p>
My main web page looks seems like a poster -- a beating heart as the entrance for the next web page, and using some <em>attribute tags</em> and <em>circuits</em> to illusacte the characteristic of programmer :).
</p>
<p>
The image gallery pages on my site will be based on this design which I want to be the following...
</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="design2.png" alt="page 2 design" width="520" height="400" />
</div>
<p>
According to four principles, proximity, alignment, repetition, contrast. I made the following table.
In terms of Proximity, related items should be placed near each other and look organized. I separated the yellow images and red images which represents normal member and VIP respectively. Besides, the whitespace helps separate different subjects.
As can be seen from the table, the clear lines separates different models on the page. Text and images line up with other text and images.
How about repetition? I use the same font, same rule for the entire page and use a consistent colour for the same model. All these designs create a unify presentation. 
Finally is the contrast. I use really different colour standout from the background. And different typefaces, font size to create contrast.

</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>
I couldn't figure out how to use CSS to fill up the empty part of left-down in the webpage;
</p>
<p>
Once I saw the page on screen, I decided to change the whole construction of the page. I thought that inserting the largest picture in the middle of the page could be better. And others can be inserted randomly.
